_SHELL_GUIDE = """\
Execution tools (always bound — not listed in <AVAILABLE_TOOLS>):
- run_command: Sync shell — waits for completion and returns output. Default timeout 60s; pass timeout for longer bounded jobs (max 5h, e.g. timeout=3600). Use for: ls, curl, git, make test, one-shot scripts.
- run_background: Async shell — returns PID + log_path immediately. Use for: servers, daemons, training, long builds you poll separately. Follow with tail_background_log/read_file; stop with kill_process.
- run_python: Execute Python code with session persistence. Variables persist across calls.
- tail_background_log: Read the last N lines from a run_background log (bg-{{pid}}.log).
- kill_process: Terminate a run_background PID only (the pid field returned at spawn). Never kill the agent host process or use pkill/killall against the runtime that spawned you.

Choose run_command vs run_background:
- Need output/exit code in this step → run_command (set timeout if >60s).
- Process keeps running after spawn (HTTP server, nohup job) → run_background.
- Unsure duration but must block until done → run_command with generous timeout.
"""

_FILE_OPS_GUIDE = """\
File operation tools:
- read_file: Read file contents (optional start_line, end_line for ranges).
- write_file: Write to files (mode='overwrite' or 'append').
- delete: Delete files (use backup=true to create automatic backup).
- search_files: Search for pattern in files (grep-like).
- list_files: List files matching pattern.
- file_info: Get file metadata.
"""

_SURGICAL_EDIT_GUIDE = """\
Surgical editing tools (PREFERRED over full-file rewrites):
- edit_lines: Replace specific line range (safer than read→modify→write).
- insert_lines: Insert content at specific line.
- delete_lines: Delete specific line range.
- apply_diff: Apply unified diff patch.

When to use surgical editing:
- Changing a specific function → use edit_lines
- Adding imports → use insert_lines at line 1
- Removing unused code → use delete_lines
- Applying code review patches → use apply_diff

Benefits:
- Safer: Only touch the lines you need to change
- Faster: No need to read/write entire large files
- Clearer: Changes are scoped and precise
"""

_RESEARCH_GUIDE = """\
Research tools (deferred by default — see <AVAILABLE_TOOLS> or search_tools):
- search_web: Quick web search for factual lookups, news, current events (single call).
- crawl_web: Extract clean content from a web page URL.
For deeper multi-source research, prefer dedicated research tools or specialists listed in your runtime capabilities.\
"""

_DATA_GUIDE = """\
Data inspection tools (deferred by default — see <AVAILABLE_TOOLS> or search_tools):
- inspect_data: Inspect data file structure - columns, types, samples (CSV, Excel, JSON, Parquet).
- summarize_data: Get statistical summary of data (tabular) or document summary (PDF, DOCX).
- check_data_quality: Validate data quality - missing values, duplicates, anomalies (tabular only).
- extract_text: Extract raw text from documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD).
- get_data_info: Get file metadata - size, format, page count, modification time.
- ask_about_file: Answer questions about file content (documents use AI, tabular shows schema).\
"""

_SUBAGENT_GUIDE = """\
Subagents (via the `task` tool) -- delegate ONLY when the task requires \
the subagent's unique capability:
- planner: Agentic plan design — iterative markdown execution plan; one report.
Additional subagents may be available from installed plugins; use only names listed in your runtime capabilities.\

{_SUBAGENT_GUIDE}

Progressive tool binding:
- Always bound: filesystem, surgical edits, execution (run_command, run_python, run_background, tail_background_log, kill_process), search_tools, search_skills, invoke_skill, write_todos, task, current_datetime.
- <AVAILABLE_TOOLS> lists deferred tools not yet bound to this hop. Use search_tools(query) or call a listed name to promote it for subsequent hops.
- Core/builtin skills appear in <AVAILABLE_SKILLS> on turn 0. Matching skills auto-load into <SKILL_CONTEXT> — follow those instructions before search_tools or ad-hoc web research.
- Deferred skills stay hidden until search_skills(query), invoke_skill(name), or a matching file-op path auto-discovers them.
- search_skills discovers deferred skills only. For core skills listed in <AVAILABLE_SKILLS>, use invoke_skill(name) or rely on auto-loaded <SKILL_CONTEXT>.

Key rules:
- Prefer single-purpose tools over unified dispatch tools.
- Use surgical editing (edit_lines) instead of full-file rewrites.
- Use websearch/crawl_web for lookups; use listed specialists for deeper research when available.
- Use run_command for sync shell (pass timeout when the job may exceed 60s); use run_background for servers/daemons and jobs you poll via tail_background_log; kill_process stops only run_background PIDs; run_python for Python code.
- When you need a deferred tool (data, wizsearch, HTTP, etc.), check <AVAILABLE_TOOLS> or run search_tools first.\
